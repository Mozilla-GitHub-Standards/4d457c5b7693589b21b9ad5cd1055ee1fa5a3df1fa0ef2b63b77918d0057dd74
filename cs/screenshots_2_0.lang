## NOTE: When a contact is listed on a screen, try to be consistent with the English set of names and same gender.  This is easier for the graphic person to know which one is a woman and man.  Some have photos next to the names.  If the image is not culturally relevant or appropriate, we will replace them in the localized version.


# Screen 1  (Browser) NOTE: If all caps is not appropriate in your language, you don’t need to follow the same style.  Be mindful the 3rd string below has limited space. Try to be concise.
